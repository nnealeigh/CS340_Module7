# CS340_Module7 dashboard

## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
I try to write my code in a way that makes it easily read. I do this by using obvious variable names, keeping it short, and avoiding some pitfalls like layering function calls into the same line. The CRUD module is highly adaptable and can be applied to any database that utilizes Mongo. The only change would the local host, port, and database. The database names such as "animals" wold need to be changed within each function as well. 

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I try to approach a problem by laying out each of the requirements listed, whether in the background text for an assignment, or from the rubric. This way, I know which portions of a project are more important, and what parts are more like flavor. As a student, I try to mainly rely on my course reading for completing my projects, through there have been times that I can't sort out how to get something done with just the documentation. In these cases I try to utilize other sources such as forums like StackOverflow to find similar issues that I can use to adapt the solutions onto my own issues. 

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists, in my opinion, are primarily troubleshooters. They rely on logical thinking to create and apply algorithms for solving various issues. The actual programming component is just the primary vessel for delivering these solutions. 
Specifically in this assignment, there were thousands upon thousands of entries into the .csv file that we utilized. The interface that we created allows a normal human to parse through the entries with a variety of filters and sorting mechanisms to turn it into readable data that can be quickly referenced. This makes the company's primary purpose of locating rescue animal candidates possible.
